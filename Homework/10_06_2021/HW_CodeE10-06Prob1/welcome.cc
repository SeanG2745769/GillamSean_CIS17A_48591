/*

 * Created on 
 * Purpose: 
 * Write a program that uses a structure to store the following data on a company division:
 * Division Name(such as East, West, North, or South)
 * First-Quarter Sales 
 * Second-Quarter Sales
 * Third-Quarter Sales
 * Fourth-Quarter Sales
 * Total Annual Sales
 * Average Quarterly Sale 
 * The program should use four variables of this structure. Each variable should
 * represent on of the following corporate divisions: East, West, North, and South.
 * The user should be asked for the four quarters' sales figures for each division.
 * Each division's total and average sales should be calculated and stored in the
 * appropriate member of each structure variable. These figures should then be 
 * displayed on the screen.
